# EncryptUntil

### A cryptographic protection tool that implements symmetric encryption in CBC (block chaining) mode.
The tool implements a simplified outline of the Blowfish algorithm. The encryption and decryption key are generated at runtime from the entered password, thus the decryption key is not stored anywhere on the user's device. The graphical interface is implemented on the basis of Jetpack Compose, which makes it easy to modify the design for different devices and operating systems.

#### Technology stack:
- Java 15 (AdoptOpenJDK)
- Kotlin 1.5.31
- Jetpack Compose Desktop (UI)

#### Implemented functionality:
- Key generation procedures
- Encryption of the file on the key
- Decryption of the file on the key
- Developed an application with a friendly interface
